                  <h3>Favorite Quote</h3>
                      <p><div class="two">One of my favorite quotes comes from Michael Jordan and it says "My father used to say that it's never too late to do anything you wanted to do. And he said, 'You never know what you can accomplish until you try." It's one of my favorites quote because it is very true, and it is something to live by.</div></p>


                <h3> Favorite Artists</h3>
                
                    <p><div class="two"> Have a lot of Artists that I like but the ones that are my favorite is Kendrick Lamar and J Cole. They are my favorite because they can rap about real things (gang violence,family life, girl problems) but can also switch it up and rap about mainstream things (money, cars, clothes, etc) and still make the music so good. Favorite song from Kendrick is Alright"and from J Cole is "Trouble"</div></p>
                    
                    <h3>Favorite Movie and TV Show</h3>
                        <p><div class="two">My hands down favorite movie has to be 22 jump street. I never laughed so hard in my life before I saw that movie. I don't know but when I watch that movie, it just makes me wanna be extremely immature and goofy.</div></p>
                        <p><div class="two">One of my favorite shows has to be between The Office and Friday Night Lights. The Office is one of my favorite shows because the show just kind of connects with you and you makes you wanna keep watching (Also with Friday Night Lights)</div></p>
