        <h3>About Me</h3>
            
                <p><div class="two">I was born on September 29, 1998 in Chicago, Illinois and I am currently a Junior at King College Prep High School and I hope to go to Oklahoma State University to study Sports Communication so I can persue my dream in being a Sports Analyst.</div></p>
                
            
        <h3>My First Love</h3>

                    <p><div class="two">I absolutely LOVE Basketball! Ever since the Mavericks won the NBA Championship in 2011, I've been hooked on basketball. I remember staying up late during that summer on Wikipedia and Youtube reading about and watching Basketball so I can know everything about the sport. When I came back to the school for my 7th grade year, I knew basically everything there was to know about the sport. And know everybody says "How is he trash at hooping but he know everything about it?" They tweaking because I'm actually decent! My dream is to be a Sports Analyst or a coach one day.</div> </p>
        
        <h3>More about me</h3>
        
                        <p><div class="two">The people who know me knows that I am one of the funniest, sarcastic, happiest, non-chalant, annoying,bipolar person they know. Earlier in my life I wasn't really like this, I was extremely shy and sensitive and I really didn't want to be different from many people. But that all changed after my Dad passed away late April of my freshman year. That was the hardest thing I ever had to go through and it changed me in many ways. After he passed, I slowly became him: I have his sense of humor, leadership, love of tech, love for people, and people just love to be around me like they loved to be around him. After his passing was dark times for me but nowadays I'm always smiling, laughing, joking around, and I have a new found confidence in myself because I have "glo'd up"slightly (still ugly, just not as ugly)</div></p>
