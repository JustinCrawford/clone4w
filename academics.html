            <h1>Education and Beliefs</h1>
<h2>Education</h2>
        <p> <div class="two">I went to many different elementary schools when I was a child (5 to be exact). But I graduated from Beasley Academic Center in 2013.I currently go to <a href="http://www.newkcp.org">King College Prep </a> and I will be graduating in 2017 and hopefully go to Oklahoma State to major in sports communication. </div></p>
        
        <h2>Beliefs on Leadership and teamwork</h2>
        <p><div class="two">Leadership to me means one person (or many people) aiding others in an assertive way to achieve one common goal. And with teamwork, I believe it means a group of people working together as one to, like I stated in my leadership definition, achieve one goal. To me, the two go hand and hand with each other.</div></p>
